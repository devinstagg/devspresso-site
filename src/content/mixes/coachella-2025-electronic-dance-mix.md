A live mix featuring almost 20 artists playing Coachella 2025, with a couple of remixes by artists also performing at the festival plus an amazing Chris Lorenzo and Amyl & The Sniffers collab.

The electronic lineup is unbelievable (as always). Hopefully this mix helps you discover some new artists you might see at the festival!

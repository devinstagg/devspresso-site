A collection of house songs constantly playing in my head and/or during a normal workday. Not perfect and still learning, but thanks for listening!

Also my first recorded session, so sorry for any weird audio glitches that pop up... still working out the kinks.

Mixed October 20, 2021 on Numark Mixtrack Pro (Mix 001)

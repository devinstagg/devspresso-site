A collection of songs to keep you moving throughout your work day (or night). Really love the Papa Was a Rolling Stone remix I stumbled upon after seeing the Broadway show Ain't Too Proud (about The Temptations).

Also included an original song from Kevin May, who introduced me to house music and DJing.

Mixed February 22, 2022 on Numark Mixtrack Pro

Get to know 25 different electronic artists who will be playing Coachella 2023! Some are originals, some remixes, and for some artists (like Eric Prydz) I took some creative liberty with the song choice.

The electronic lineup this year is unbelievable.

Mixed March 17, 2023 on Numark Mixtrack Pro (Mix 008)
